	<h1>Essential Metals</h1>
	<p>Human bodies use metals in many ways, from the iron that makes our blood red to the calcium in our bones and teeth. <br>
	These metals are called “<b>essential metals</b>” because they are essential to our bodies’ functions. <br>
	We get these essential metals from the food we eat and the water we drink.<br>
	Even essential metals can be toxic at high concentrations.<br>
